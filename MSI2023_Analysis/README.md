## MSI2023 Analysis
This is my first project where I've worked with a real dataset (the matches of MSI 2023 League of Legends Tournament). After exploring, clearing (didn't really have to do much for this one as the original data was already in pretty good shape), post-processing and analyzing the dataset, I've created a Reddit post with the insights I've come up with, can be seen here: [Week1](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/13e2r2d/i_analyzed_all_msi_2023_games_from_week_1_heres/) and [Week2](https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/13ihvlf/i_analyzed_all_msi_2023_games_from_week_2_heres/).
The data has been aggregated and released by Tim Sevenhuysen of OraclesElixir.com, can be found at https://oracleselixir.com/tools/downloads
